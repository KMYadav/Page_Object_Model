# Page_Object_Model
POM As per the Page Object Model, we have maintained a class for every web page.
Each web page has a separate class and that class holds the functionality and members of that web page.
Separate classes for every individual test.
POM is a design approach while PageFactory is a class which provides implementation of Page Object Model design approach.
